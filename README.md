# For small representations - the Ordlicon icon font. 

*The representation of icons on websites and applications has become increasingly large in recent years. Accordingly, they have also been designed to be filigree and rich in detail. In contrast to consumer applications, icons are also used in very small sizes for specialised applications. I have developed the ¬´ordlicon¬ª icon font for this application.*


Icons are and always have been one of my great passions. The challenge of compressing and elaborating information so that it fits into a simple graphic still fascinates me today. Professionally and privately, I have developed numerous icons over the past years - as a single, independent icon or as a small, application-specific collection. 

Now I have developed my own icon font. Thanks to the pandemic, I had time to create the basic stock of around 400 icons in loving and time-consuming manual work. In the meantime it has become 696. And I think there will be more to come.

ordlicon is designed for use in applications: Small and clear representation of the icons. The design is independent and the themes are limited. I make the library available to the world for free use under the open-source licence. Download it, extend and change the icons and build great user-centred applications with it. Happy creation!
